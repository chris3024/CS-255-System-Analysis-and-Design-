# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

#### <ins>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</ins>
The DriverPass project was presented to us by the client, DriverPass. The system that was asked to be designed was one that could be beneficial for many different people. This system is for a cloud-based web-app that will allow for individuals to have written and on road testing to help many people of reaching thier goal of having their drivers license. 

#### <ins>What did you do particularly well?</ins>
I feel like I captured many bits of the functionality of the system that the client was asking to be incorporated in the system. I also feel that I captured the different functionalities in the view of the different diagrams that were created.

#### <ins>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</ins>
The one part of the business requirements documents that I am not the happiest with is the scheduling portion. I would like to rework it to include more details about the timeline that is need to complete the project. This will allow for a clearer picture to both the teams working on the project as well as the client.

#### <ins>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</ins>
I interpreted the user's needs in the system design by taking the functionality that has been requested, and then I applied that to make sure the flows were correct and were not confusing or casued extra steps to provide that functionality. It is very important to consider the user's needs when designing the system. If the system does not provide the functionality that is required for the client, then the system is essentialy useless to the client. 
  
#### <ins>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</ins>
In the future, when I am designing software I will look back on the ideas and methods that I learned in this class. For example, writing out the system functionality and what I want the system to be able to do. Then, collecting all of the requirements that I will need for the software to function, from interactions to the classes that make up the software. Then producing the code base and on to testing and delivery. I will use many of the techniques and strategies that we have learned in this class to accomplish the end goal.
